I am a Research Associate at [CYENS CoE](https://www.cyens.org.cy) and a Ph.D. student at the 
[Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/) at UCY, under the supervision of
[Dr. Melinos Averkiou](https://www.cyens.org.cy/en-gb/about/people/research-department/multidisciplinary-research-groups/mrg-leaders/melinos-averkiou-1/)
and [Prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/). My research topics include 3D computer vision, 3D deep learning and geometry processing.

I am particularly interested in deep learning architectures that process 3D shape representations and can infer semantics of real world environments.
