I am currently a Research Associate at [CYENS CoE](https://www.cyens.org.cy). I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from 
the [University of Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/), advised by [Prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://kalo-ai.github.io/) 
and [Dr. Melinos Averkiou](https://www.cyens.org.cy/en-gb/about/people/research-department/multidisciplinary-research-groups/mrg-leaders/melinos-averkiou-1/).
My research topics include 3D computer vision, 3D deep learning and geometry processing.

I am particularly interested in deep learning architectures that process 3D shape representations and can infer semantics of real world environments. 
You can find my [CV here](https://marios2019.github.io/assets/pdf/Marios_Loizou_CV.pdf).
